# Fake-Job-Prediction
A model to predict fraudulent job postings from the legitimate ones

## Dataset
The dataset contains 18K job descriptions out of which about 800 are fake. The data consists of both textual information and meta-information about the jobs. The dataset can be used to create classification models which can learn the job descriptions which are fraudulent.
## Concept used
### Random Forest Classification
This algorithm has been incorporated in this project.The reason for why this works best is that random forest consists of a large number of individual decision trees that operate as an ensemble.Each individual tree in the random forest spits out a class prediction and the class with the most votes becomes our modelâ€™s prediction.
